# BLE_UI

A lightweight Web UI for interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

## What this project is

This repository contains a small web UI (`web_ble_ui.html`) that allows connecting to and inspecting BLE devices from a web browser that supports the Web Bluetooth API.

## Quick start (local)

1. Open `web_ble_ui.html` in a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge) that supports Web Bluetooth.
2. Make sure your device supports BLE and you have Bluetooth enabled.

## Next steps

- Initialize a remote GitHub repo and push this project (optional).
- Add a license or other docs as needed.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome — open an issue if you want to discuss a new feature first.

## License

This project does not include a license file yet. Add one if you want to make the project explicitly open-source.
